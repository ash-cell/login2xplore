# Employee Form Management System

## Description

This project is a dynamic employee management system that leverages JsonPowerDB for handling employee data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and navigate through records seamlessly. The application provides a clean user interface and efficient backend handling for managing employee information such as ID, name, salary, and other details.

## Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB

- Minimal Setup: The lightweight database minimizes configuration complexity.
- Ease of Use: JsonPowerDB's RESTful APIs make integration and operations straightforward.
- Flexible Data Model: It supports a variety of data models, making it adaptable for different use cases.
- Scalability: JsonPowerDB is built to scale as application demands grow.
- Security: Offers in-built authentication and token-based security measures.
